        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>This is Dovuq's personal blog, while the address is <a href="https://dovuq.github.io">https://dovuq.github.io/</a>.</p>
        <div id="more" style="display: none">
            <p>The blog mainly consists of different kinds of tools the owner frequently uses, such as mathematics tools, physics tables, as well as frequently used OI algorithms. 
                However, I have to apologize that many parts of this blogs are not perfect, and thus I am still keeping updating, so sometimes you will find that the blog has already changed a lot.
                By the way, if you have got something interesting, and you think it is great to add it to this blog, you can contact the owner, Dovuq. The addresses are at the end of this page.

            <!--<p>Now let me tell you how to use the most important parts of the blog, i.e. points list and code of conduct.
                If you contribute, you will get some points. All users' points are shown on the points page, and you can see your points there. You will be able to see your points by logging in in the future, but I am still focus on it. 
                What's more, if you are new here, it is necessary to see the code of conduct carefully. There are some codes you must obey.</p>
            <p>So, let's get started. View the <a href="/points">points page</a> and the <a href="/code_of_conduct">code of conduct</a> right now!</p>-->
