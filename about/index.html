        <h2>About the Blog</h2>

                The blog mainly consists of different kinds of tools the owner frequently uses, such as mathematics tools, physics tables, as well as frequently used OI algorithms. 
                However, I have to apologize that many parts of this blogs are not perfect, and thus I am still keeping updating, so sometimes you will find that the blog has already changed a lot.
                By the way, if you have got something interesting, and you think it is great to add it to this blog, you can contact the owner, Dovuq. The addresses are at the end of this page. 
                In addition, if you have any suggestions, or you find any mistakes in the blog, please do not hesitate to tell me at the <a href="https://www.github.com/dovuq/dovuq.github.io/issues">issue page</a>, and don't forget to @Dovuq. If you do, I would appreciate a lot for that.
