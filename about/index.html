        <h2>About the Blog</h2>
        <p>This is Dovuq's personal blog, whose URL is <a href="https://dovuq.github.io">https://dovuq.github.io/</a>.</p>
        <p>
            Recently, the blog mainly consists of different kinds of useful tools, such as mathematics tables, physics tables, as well as frequently used OI algorithms. 
            <!--However, I have to apologize that many parts of this blogs are not perfect, and thus I am still keeping updating. And due to my poor English level, some of the posts may be written in Simplified Chinese or in both languages. Occasionally, correctness in posts in English couldn't be maintained, nor can clarity sometimes.
            Therefore, if you find any mistakes in the blog, or you have got something interesting which you think is great to be added to this blog, you can contact the owner, Dovuq. The ways to contact me are at the bottom of this page. -->
            However, due to my busy schedule at school, I hadn't got time to update this page for nearly two years. Now I haven't thought of what to include in this website.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is suitable to tell me your opinions at the <a href="https://www.github.com/dovuq/dovuq.github.io/issues">issue page</a>, and don't forget to @Dovuq. If you do, I would appreciate it a lot.
        </p>
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I'm a student who has just graduated from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhenhai_Middle_School">Zhenhai High School of Ningbo</a>, a senior high school in Zhenhai District, Ningbo, Zhejiang Province, P. R. China., and is going to study at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fudan_University">Fudan University</a>, a university in Shanghai Municipality, P. R. China. My major is mathematics, but I will focus on computer science too.
            <!--I'm learning Olympiad in Informatics (OI) and Mathematics Olympiad (MO) at present, but majorly OI.-->
            I'm working on my personal website <a href="/">dovuq.github.io</a> discontinuously, which means I will only update it when I would like to. In addition, I am also a hobbyist in piano.
        </p>
